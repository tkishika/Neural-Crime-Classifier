# Crime Type Prediction

This project predicts the type of crime based on factors like location, time, and victim information using a neural network model.

## ðŸ“Š Dataset

The dataset includes features such as:
- Time of occurrence
- Police area code
- Victimâ€™s age
- Victimâ€™s sex
- Victimâ€™s descent
- Latitude & Longitude

The target is to classify the type of crime (`Crm Cd Desc`).

## ðŸ§  Model Used

A multi-class classification model built using:
- TensorFlow / Keras
- Dense neural network with ReLU and Softmax layers

## ðŸ”§ Tech Stack

- **Pandas** & **NumPy** for data handling
- **Scikit-learn** for encoding and scaling
- **TensorFlow / Keras** for model training
